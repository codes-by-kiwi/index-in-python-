newstring = "Coronavirus is a serious pandemic!"
print(newstring.index("o")) #this prints out 1 because the location of the first occurence of "o" is
#1 character away from the 1st character. Notice only the 1st o is considered. However, if you used .count("o") it would 
#print 3 because there are 3 o's in this string
